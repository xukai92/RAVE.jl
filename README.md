## tl;dr

Check `notebooks/bnpvae.ipynb` for the notebook that contains almost everything you would want to reproduce from our paper.

The soure code (in `src`) is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) mostly with the [Knet.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl) deep learning framework. I hope the code is clean enough so that even you never used Julia before would understand. 
Some basic instructions for people haven't used Julia before would be added soon.
